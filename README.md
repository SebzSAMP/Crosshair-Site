# Crosshair-Site
This is a crosshair site I made to replace cali-kartell.de, the previous go-to crosshair site for San Andreas Multiplayer.



Thanks to Didey (https://github.com/Didey) for helping to automate the creation of the code for 300 crosshairs.

Special thanks to the creator of cali-kartell.de for this initial website and ultimately the idea for this remake.
